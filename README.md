# GroceryItemTracker

# Project Summary and Problem Solving
The GroceryItemTracker project manages grocery items, tracking their names, quantities, prices, and expiration dates. It helps users efficiently organize and reduce food waste by identifying low-stock or expired items.

# What Went Well
Developed an intuitive system for adding, updating, and deleting items.
Implemented basic error handling to check for duplicates.
Provided simple, user-friendly navigation.


# Areas for Enhancement
Add sorting/filtering by expiration or category.
Implement input validation for price/quantity.
Refactor into classes/functions for better organization.


# Most Challenging Aspects
Handling and comparing expiration dates, overcome using C++ date libraries.
Memory management issues addressed with proper pointers/references.


# Transferable Skills
Skills in data management, validation, and error handling, useful for future C++ projects.
Experience with memory management and C++ libraries.


Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
Used clear, well-commented code and consistent naming conventions.
Designed the program to be easily updated or expanded (e.g., adding a database or UI).
